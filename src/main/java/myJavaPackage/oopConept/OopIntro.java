//oop = object oriented programming concept
    /*
    object Oriented programming means- when we have
    veriable and methods in a class to use those we
    need to create an object so veriable and methods
    belong to the object.

    class is a templete/prototype- object is a real
    demonstration of that tamplete.

    is java 100 % object oriented programming languege?

    no, because we have-
    1. static member
    2. data type- byte,int, short
    3. abstract class interface - We cannot
    create an object.

    /* Oop has 5 principle

    1-Inheritance

 Single Inheritance = class B extends ClassA
 Multilevel Inheritance = Class B extends
     Class A,Class C extends class

    heriarchial inheritance =
    hrbrid Inheritance =
   multiple Inheritance =

   2- Polymorphism (overloading,Overriding)-- many forms
    3- Abstraction(abstract class, Interface)
    4- Encapsulation
    5- interface
